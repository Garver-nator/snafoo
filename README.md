This is a protype website made an an application to The Nerdery, it supports users voting on which snacks they would like to be delivered to the office, 
and allows users to suggest new snacks they would like to vote on. The snack data is from a Nerdery API, the website manages the voting. 

Tests can be found in /spec/, and are all currently passing.
